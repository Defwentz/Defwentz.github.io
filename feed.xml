Almost 2 months total, although I took weeks off inbetween. I’m happy enough with result that I would work on an update. Also Godot export to Android is surprisingly easy and fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Extra: I did realize the two viewers on the left are basically useless to the player and just confuses them after watching a friend play. But the extra bit is nice, I do still think people are attracted to complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also people don’t really use the sonar, it needs a much bigger button so they notice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="games" /><summary type="html">It started with wave propagation simulation with grids, and ended with I really just want to finish this thing, it’s taking so long (a month and change) and has so many limitations.

And with a system in place, the game can generate its own skills and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oof, this random small idea i had took exactly a year, and I just want to stop working on it. But hey, it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nano Trip is a game project with 1-xing. I think someone came with the idea of making something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microtrip-game.com/&quot;&gt;Microtrip&lt;/a&gt;, and I throw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby:_Canvas_Curse&quot;&gt;Kirby: Canvas Curse&lt;/a&gt;, which I always remember fondly of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you fall down the infinitely generated environment as a blob, by using gestures to draw lines in the environment or tilting your device, you try to prevent your blob from touching the enmeies and last as long as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a great time. A clear goal, it was summer during college so I’m on it everyday, and it came to fruition in less than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in Cocos2d-X, unfortunately it’s gone from all the app stores, tho I would like to remake it at some point. And it’s public on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Defwentz/Nana-Trip&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. Also also, it was available for both Android and iOS and that was something.&lt;/p&gt;
