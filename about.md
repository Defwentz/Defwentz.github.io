My name is Wenxuan Zhu. I enjoy learning, becoming better and understanding basic principles behind things. Here is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/cv-lite.pdf).

I'm enjoy movies and games. I think of game as an art form. I also do English-to-Chinese translation and point out references in fansub groups for [classic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056751/?ref_=nv_sr_2)/[new](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/?ref_=nv_sr_2) Doctor Who and [Psych](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491738/).
